NSD Term Project
================

This is the directory to turn in the term project proposal.  To turn it in, you
need **a PR** and **an E3 entry for the PR URL**.  See
https://yyc.solvcon.net/en/latest/nsd/schedule/nsd_21au_nycu.html for what
should be included in the proposal and project.

The proposal accounts for 8 points out of the 40 points allocated to the term
project.  Like homework, you will need to create a PR against the ``proposal``
branch (not ``master``).  You need to create a sub-directory using exactly your
GitHub username as your working directory (``nsdhw_21au/proposal/$username/``).
The hierarchy should be like::

  - nsdhw_21au (<- repository root)
    - proposal
      - username (<- your working directory)
        - README.rst (<- the main proposal file)
        - ... other files for your proposal

When submitting your proposal, name the PR as ``<username>-proposal**``, e.g.,
``yungyuc-proposal-submission``.  Don't forget to put the PR URL in the E3
entry too.  You can request my review in the PR for discussions.

Presentation
============

Each presentation can use at most 25 minutes (subject to change before the
schedule is determined). It is suggested that the presentation itself uses
about 20 minutes. The 5 minutes are left for questions and discussions. But
presenters may decide how to use their time. Presenters are expect to prepare
computers for presentation. The time for setting up the computer is included in
the allotted presentation time.

If presenters have difficulty in preparing a computer themselves, they may seek
help from the instructor, and resolve the issue one week before their
presentation.
